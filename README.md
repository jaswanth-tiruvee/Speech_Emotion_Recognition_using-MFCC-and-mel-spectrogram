# Speech_Emotion_Recognition_using MFCC and mel-spectrogram


This project focuses on developing an advanced **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system capable of identifying human emotions from audio signals. By leveraging state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques, such as **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Mel-Spectrogram analysis, the model provides a reliable classification of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality.

The pipeline incorporates robust preprocessing steps to clean and normalize audio data, ensuring consistent performance across diverse datasets. The machine learning model is trained on a curated dataset with optimized hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.

An intuitive Streamlit-based interface is integrated, allowing users to upload audio files and visualize emotion predictions in real-time. This interactive platform enhances user engagement and provides a seamless experience for exploring model capabilities.

Applications for this project span across industries, including **customer sentiment analysis**, **virtual assistants, and **emotional intelligence in human-computer interaction systems**. The modular design ensures easy adaptation and integration into various workflows.

The repository includes comprehensive documentation, detailed code comments, and sample datasets for quick deployment. Developers and researchers can further enhance the model by experimenting with new datasets or fine-tuning the existing architecture. Dive into this project to unlock the potential of speech-driven emotional analysis!
